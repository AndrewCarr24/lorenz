# lorenz 

lorenz is an R package that provides two methods for deriving exact incomes from grouped income data, which is the format of public income data in the U.S. Census.  

The first method, mean-constrained integration over brackets, is an implementation of a technique described in Jargowsky and Wheeler's 2018 paper.  The second method, Lorenz interpolation, is based on a new method that samples incomes from an interpolated Lorenz curve.
