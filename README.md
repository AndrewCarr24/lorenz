# lorenz Package

This package provides two methods for sampling exact incomes from grouped income data, which is the format of public income data in the U.S. Census.  

The first method, mean-constrained integration over brackets, is an implementation of a technique described in Jargowsky and Wheeler's 2018 paper.  The second method, Lorenz interpolation, is based on a new method introduced by the author of this package.
